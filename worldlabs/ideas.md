# Ideas

- Show that black mirror episode to the team in which that CS guy puts his clone into the center of his artificial universe and has him build planets. This might be a fun weekend project to try out: a world-building agent that goes and creates a world.
- World-website like that one that was shared today but much easier to make: take photos / video of your room or scene; place objects in it (properly scanned / or maybe injected differently) and allow for the exploration of the scanned scene using SPMEM. I.e., the splats are the memory. Interactions could be maybe implemented via training a video model on that dataset of human labor that this 18y/o genious implemented.
- How far can I go today with scanning a room?
- How far can we go today with transforming movies into scenes? I guess that's how the hobbit cave was created?
- Instagram paper with the animated Gaussian splats might be interesting starting point for populating worlds with animated objects / grounding with animated objects.
